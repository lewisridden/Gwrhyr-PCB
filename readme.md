# PCB for Gwrhyr 
The flex PCB for Gwrhyr is forked from an improved variant of the BastardKB open-source manuform board, including the improvements for shape and access made by crystalhand.

The board has been modified in the following ways:
- Key footprints changed to Choc switches using the [reversible footprint by Keebio](https://github.com/keebio/Keebio-Parts.pretty/blob/master/Kailh-PG1350-1u-No-Clickhole.kicad_mod)
- Updated diode footprint to one from above Keebio library 
- inter-column connections replaced with through-hole connections to better fit custom staggers
- Added HAT thumb cluster for the Gwrhyr
- Added board mount derived from [Swanmatch's ProMicro-Home](https://github.com/swanmatch/MxLEDBitPCB/tree/master/MxLEDBitPCB-promicro)
